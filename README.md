# Rock‑Paper‑Scissors

## Description  
A simple, web‑based Rock‑Paper‑Scissors game built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players choose one of the three options and compete against the computer, with the UI updating in real time to show choices, results, and score :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
